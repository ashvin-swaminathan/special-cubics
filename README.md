This is a Magma code supplement for our paper entitled "Counting integral points on symmetric varieties with applications to arithmetic statistics." Our paper may be found on the arXiv at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01050.

Copy the file file avg.txt into your directory. Then it can be loaded into magma using the command 

load "avg.txt"; 

The code is adapted from a program originally written by Manjul Bhargava.
