# special-cubics

This is a Magma code supplement for our paper entitled "Counting integral points on symmetric varieties with applications to arithmetic statistics." Our paper may be found on the arXiv at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.01050.

Each of the programs in this repository computes the average 2-torsion in the class group over approximately 100,000 cubic fields in the special famuly defined by binary cubic forms with leading and final coefficients fixed elements of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The code is adapted from a program originally written by Manjul Bhargava.
